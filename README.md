member is temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate
responsibilities to keep to schedule. In the event of longer-term illness or other serious
problems involving a member of group, it is the responsibility of the other members to
notify immediately the Unit Convenor or relevant tutor.
Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all
members of the group.
All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted. Any

PART C: FURTHER INFORMATION
Student behaviour and wellbeing
All students are expected to: act with integrity, honesty and fairness; be inclusive, ethical and
respectful of others; and appropriately use University resources, information, equipment and facilities.
All students are expected to contribute to creating a work and study environment that is safe and free
from bullying, violence, discrimination, sexual harassment, vilification and other forms of unacceptable
behaviour.
The Student Charter describes what students can reasonably expect from Swinburne in order to enjoy
a quality learning experience. The Charter also sets out what is expected of students with regards to
your studies and the way you conduct yourself towards other people and property.
You are expected to familiarise yourself with University regulations and policies and are obliged to
abide by these, including the Student Academic Misconduct Regulations, Student General
Misconduct Regulations and the People, Culture and Integrity Policy. Any student found to be in
breach of these may be subject to disciplinary processes.
Examples of expected behaviours are:
• conducting yourself in teaching areas in a manner that is professional and not disruptive to
others
• following specific safety procedures in Swinburne laboratories, such as wearing appropriate
footwear and safety equipment, not acting in a manner which is dangerous or disruptive (e.g.
playing computer games), and not bringing in food or drink
• following emergency and evacuation procedures and following instructions given by
staff/wardens in an emergency response
Canvas
You should regularly access the Swinburne learning management system, Canvas, which is available
via the Current Students webpage or https://swinburne.instructure.com/ Canvas is updated regularly
with important unit information and communications.
Communication
All communication will be via your Swinburne email address. If you access your email through a
provider other than Swinburne, then it is your responsibility to ensure that your Swinburne email is
redirected to your private email address.
Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is about taking responsibility for your learning and submitting work that is honestly
your own. It means acknowledging the ideas, contributions and work of others; referencing your
sources; contributing fairly to group work; and completing tasks, tests and exams without cheating.
Swinburne University uses the Turnitin system, which helps to identify inadequate citations, poor
paraphrasing and unoriginal work in assignments that are submitted via Canvas. Your Unit Convenor
will provide further details.
Plagiarising, cheating and seeking an unfair advantage with regards to an exam or assessment are all
breaches of academic integrity and treated as academic misconduct.
Plagiarism is submitting or presenting someone else’s work as though it is your own without full and
appropriate acknowledgement of their ideas and work. Examples include:
• using the whole or part of computer program written by another person as your own
For further information on any of these topics, refer to Swinburne’s Student
webpage http://www.swinburne.edu.au/student/
TNE20003_Unit Outline_S2_2023 Page 8 of 9
Version: Unit Outline Template v4.1 2023
• using the whole or part of somebody else’s written work in an essay or other assessable
work, including material from a book, journal, newspaper article, a website or database, a set
of lecture notes, current or past student’s work, or any other person’s work
• poorly paraphrasing somebody else’s work
• using a musical composition or audio, visual, graphic and photographic work created by
another
• using realia created by another person, such as objects, artefacts, costumes, models
• submitting assessments that have been developed by another person or service (paid or
unpaid), often referred to as contract cheating
• presenting or submitting assignments or other work in conjunction with another person or
group of people when that work should be your own independent work. This is regardless of
whether or not it is with the knowledge or consent of the other person(s). Swinburne
encourages students to talk to staff, fellow students and other people who may be able to
contribute to a student’s academic work but where an independent assignment is required,
the work must be the student’s own
• enabling others to plagiarise or cheat, including letting another student copy your work or by
giving access to a draft or completed assignment
The penalties for academic misconduct can be severe, ranging from a zero grade for an assessment
task through to expulsion from the unit and, in the extreme, exclusion from Swinburne.
Student support
Swinburne offers a range of services and resources to help you complete your studies successfully.
Your Unit Convenor or studentHQ can provide information about the study support and other services
available for Swinburne students.
Special consideration
If your studies have been adversely affected due to serious and unavoidable circumstances outside of
your control (e.g. severe illness or unavoidable obligation), you may be able to apply for special
consideration (SPC).
Applications for Special Consideration will be submitted via the SPC online tool normally no later than
5.00pm on the third working day after the submission/sitting date for the relevant assessment
component.
Accessibility needs
Sometimes students with a disability, a mental health or medical condition or significant carer
responsibilities require reasonable adjustments to enable full access to and participation in education.
Your needs can be addressed by Swinburne's AccessAbility Services by negotiating and distributing
an 'Education Access Plan'. The plan makes recommendations to University teaching and
examination staff. You must notify AccessAbility Services of your disability or condition within one
week after the commencement of your unit to allow the University to make reasonable adjustments.
Review of marks
An independent marker reviews all fail grades for major assessment tasks. In addition, a review of
assessment is undertaken if your final result is between 45 and 49 or within 2 marks of any grade
threshold.
You can ask the Unit Convenor to check the result for an assessment item or your final result. Your
request must be made in writing within 10 working days of receiving the result. The Unit Convenor can
discuss the marking criteria with you and check the aggregate marks of assessment components to
identify if an error has been made. This is known as local resolution.
If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of the local resolution, you can lodge a formal complaint.
Feedback, complaints and suggestions
In the first instance, discuss any issues with your Unit Convenor. If your concerns are not resolved or
you would prefer not to deal with your Unit Convenor, then you can complete a feedback form. See
https://www.swinburne.edu.au/corporate/feedback/
