To complete the lab tasks involving Snort (an Intrusion Detection System or IDS) and nmap (a port scanner), follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the Purpose of the Lab**
- The purpose of this lab is to learn about port scanning and intrusion detection systems.
- You will use two virtual machines, and one of them will have Snort (IDS) installed.
- The other machine will use nmap for port scanning.

**Step 2: Host Configuration**
- Make sure both hosts have been configured with IP addresses. Note these IP addresses.
- You can check the IP addresses using the `ifconfig` command.
- Verify connectivity between both hosts using the `ping` command.

**Step 3: Testing Snort**
- Validate that Snort is working on VM1.
- Open a terminal on VM1 and run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo snort -i 3 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -T
   ```

- You should see a series of messages, including "Snort successfully validated the configuration!"

**Step 4: Add a Rule to Detect Pings**
- Edit the Snort config file to add a local rule. Use your preferred text editor or `gedit`:

   ```bash
   sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
   ```

- Add the following line to detect ICMP (ping) traffic:

   ```
   alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP"; sid:1000001;)
   ```

- This rule will detect and report pings. Save the file.

- Run Snort in intrusion detection mode reporting all exceptions to the console:

   ```bash
   sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console
   ```

- From VM2, ping VM1. You should see a notification of the pings in the Snort console.

**Step 5: Testing the IDS with Common Attacks**
- Use nmap from VM2 to perform a port scan on VM1. Replace `ipaddress` with the IP address of VM1:

   ```bash
   nmap -system-dns -v -A ipaddress
   ```

- Observe the information shown in the nmap output.

- Check the Snort console to see what messages Snort generated as a result of the port scan.
- You can use Wireshark to identify some of these messages.

- Perform a tunnelling attack using the hts and htc commands as previously learned and see if Snort detects the tunnelling of telnet through port 80.

**Step 6: Assessment of the Lab**
- Show your instructor that you have Snort running and have carried out the attacks as listed.

- Be prepared to answer the instructor's questions, such as explaining what port scanning and intrusion detection are, why port scanning is a threat, and whether Snort detected the attacks.

This lab helps you understand the capabilities and limitations of intrusion detection systems like Snort and their role in securing networks.
